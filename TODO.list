study use DataGrids (maybe default MUI grids???)
pack images in webpack
index.html in webpack?
drawing graphs - mostly for elevation
- web ads
- use Figma and AnimaApp? (maybe if getting hang of basics and looks promising)
use NodeJS & Express for generating Google Maps on server and hiding API key
-- Links to different things (The Shop, Imbaraga)
-- Cycling teams and regular meetups in Kigali (low priority)
Rewrite at least one component in Typescript
figure out how not to expose Google API key
design architecture
- load route details from a db?

- tiny issues
  - use router in App and open RoutePreview via router for changed route (then map should load correctly)
  - in graph don't use 2.2k for height, write the whole number
  - figure out responsiveness of grid - should change number of columns when resized
  - use theme for selected and hover over choices in the left bar
  - figure out ellipsis for RouterList route names as necessary
